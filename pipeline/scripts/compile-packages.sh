# Title: Compile packages
# Description: This script complies the service packages located in the packages/ directory of this repository. The packages which correspond to the NEDs enlisted as keys in the netsims path of the config.yaml file are skipped. It is required to provide a service name associated to a NSO container as given in the docker-compose file.
# Author: @ponchotitlan
#
# Usage:
#   ./compile-packages.sh <service-name>

# This function issues the make clean all command on the src/directory of the package specified.
# It is assumed that the package already exists on the /packages dir of this repository and that this dir is a mounted volume in the NSO container provided.
# Usage compile_package <container_name(str)> <package_folder_name(str)>
